Motivation:

As a dentist with experience in patient care and health management, I’ve always been fascinated by the intricate connections between environmental factors and human health. Having a personal history with asthma I'm eager to delve deeper into understanding how air quality impacts respiratory health, particularly in individuals with asthma.


Data Questions:

1. Find correlation between air quality and prevalence of asthma in adults and children.

2. Analyze Asthma mortality rate by states.

3. Find out how many days each major city in the US has good air quality.

4. Analyze air quality trends in Tennessee.


Data Cleaning:

The CDC website provided asthma data from 2017 to 2021, so I obtained corresponding air quality datasets from the EPA for the same years. I created multiple dataframes for the years 2017 to 2021."


Challenges:

Some of the data provided were incomplete or incorrectly recorded, requiring me to change a few data types to facilitate merging."



Technologies Used:

Python/Pandas for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of dataset.
Tableau for dashboards
PowerPoint for introducing the project

Conclusion:

My analysis shows that there is no clear correlation between bad air quality and asthma. However, there may be a slight tendency for higher asthma percentages to coincide with higher maximum Air Quality Index (AQI) values. This relationship is complex, as other variables such as individual susceptibility, geographical factors, and socio-economic status may also influence the prevalence of asthma. Therefore, while improving air quality is undoubtedly beneficial for public health, addressing asthma comprehensively requires a multi-faceted approach.
